# Rational_expectations_solutions_under_structural_change
This project sets out a recursive solution method for linear rational expectations models subject to anticipated structural changes, as in Kulish and Pagan (2017). The baseline solution is extented to deal with delayed announcement to a fraction of agents; imperfect credibility of policy reforms; and cases where the terminal solution is indterminate. The solution refinements in the paper are complemented by analytical examples, numerical applications and codes.
