# Rational-expectations-solutions-structural-change
This project sets out a recursive solution method for linear rational expectations models subject to anticipated structural changes, as in Kulish and Pagan (2017, Journal of Applied Econometrics). The baseline solution is extended to deal with delayed announcement to a fraction of agents; imperfect credibility of policy reforms; and cases where the terminal solution is indterminate. The extensions in the paper are complemented by analytical examples, numerical applications and codes.
