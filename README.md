# Rational-expectations-solutions-structural-change
This paper Hatcher (2022, JEDC) extends the recursive solution method for linear rational expectations models subject to anticipated structural changes in Kulish and Pagan (2017, Journal of Applied Econometrics) to deal with delayed announcement to a fraction of agents; imperfect credibility of policy reforms; and cases where the terminal solution is indeterminate. The extensions in the paper are complemented by analytical examples, numerical applications and codes.
